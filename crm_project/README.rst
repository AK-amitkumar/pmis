CRM cases part of Projects
==============================

CRM tasks and CRM leads connected to project,
crm cases tab on project view. In a project oriented
company, every activity and comunication is part of a
project thus all the leads and opportunities can be
tracked also from the project form and since the issues
are also a source of project communications, they're
added as well in the view.

Although most of people consider a project started
only after a sale order is made, a true project oriented
company considers that the project starts in a way
earlier stage, right after the first need appeared.
Odoo shows the first need (request) with the lead,
which is converted to an opportunity after the first
assessment. The opportunity assessment is considered
already as the initiation stage of project management.
